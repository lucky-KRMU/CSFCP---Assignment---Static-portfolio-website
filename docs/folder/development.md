# Development Process

## 🛠️ Tools Used
The entire project was developed within **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**. Version control was managed using **Git** and the project was hosted on **GitHub**.

## 🧱 Implementation Steps
The development was divided into three main phases:

### Phase 1: Structure and Content (HTML)
* **Initialization:** The project folder was initialized using `git init`.
* **Semantic Markup:** Used HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`) to ensure the page structure was accessible and logically organized.
* **Content Insertion:** All static content, including the navigation list, personal bio, project descriptions, skills table, and contact form fields, was added.

### Phase 2: Styling and Aesthetics (CSS)
* **Global Reset:** Applied a global CSS reset (`margin: 0; padding: 0;`) for consistent rendering across browsers.
* **Visual Design:** Established a professional color palette (dark blue for primary elements, light blue-grey for the background) and set the Poppins and Noto Sans font families.
* **Layout:** Implemented a sticky header (`position: sticky;`) and used CSS to center text and manage spacing (`margin`, `padding`) for a clean look.
* **Interactivity:** Added hover states to navigation links, project cards, and table cells to improve user experience.

### Phase 3: Version Control and Documentation
* **Committing Changes:** Changes were regularly staged and committed using `git add` and `git commit` with descriptive messages to track progress accurately.
* **Repository Finalization:** The `.gitignore` file was added to exclude temporary files, and the final documentation (`README.md`, `docs/`) was created and pushed to the remote GitHub repository using `git push`.
