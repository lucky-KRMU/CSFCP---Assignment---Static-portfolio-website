# Future Improvements

While the project is fully functional as a static site, the following enhancements are planned to improve user experience and demonstrate more advanced skills:

## 1. Responsiveness and Cross-Browser Compatibility
* **Action:** Implement CSS Media Queries, Flexbox, or Grid to create a fully responsive layout.
* **Goal:** Ensure the portfolio displays optimally on all screen sizes, including mobile devices and tablets, which is a critical real-world requirement.

## 2. Dynamic Functionality (JavaScript Integration)
* **Form Validation:** Add client-side JavaScript to validate the fields in the Contact Form to provide immediate feedback to the user on input errors.
* **UI Enhancement:** Implement a simple **Dark Mode / Light Mode toggle** feature using JavaScript to allow users to customize their viewing experience.

## 3. Bonus Collaboration Feature
* **Task:** Pair with a peer to complete the collaboration step.
* **Workflow:** The peer will create a new branch, add a small feature (e.g., an "Experience" section), submit a **Pull Request**, and require a formal **Code Review** before merging their changes into the main branch. This will demonstrate proficiency in professional Git branching and GitHub workflows.
