# Project Overview

## Goal and Purpose
The primary goal of the Static Portfolio Webpage is to serve as a comprehensive online resume and professional showcase. It is designed to clearly and professionally present my technical skills (HTML/CSS) and completed projects to potential employers and collaborators.

## Target Audience
The website is specifically structured to appeal to the following audiences:
* Recruiters and hiring managers seeking front-end development skills.
* Fellow developers and potential collaborators.
* Academic staff evaluating course work, particularly for the Computer Science Fundamentals & Career Pathways course.

## Structure Summary
The site's single-page structure is organized logically into four main sections, all easily accessible via a sticky navigation bar:
1.  **Hero/About:** A personal introduction and professional statement.
2.  **Projects:** Detailed descriptions of projects, demonstrating real-world application of skills.
3.  **Skills:** An easy-to-read table of core competencies.
4.  **Contact:** A call-to-action for visitors to get in touch.
